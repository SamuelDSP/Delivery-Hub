# Delivery Hub

A full-stack delivery marketplace built with **FastAPI**, **Next.js** and **PostgreSQL**.

Delivery Hub is a modern web application where customers can browse products and place orders while sellers manage their own storefronts through a secure role-based platform.

Designed as a production-ready solution, it focuses on clean architecture, authentication, authorization, scalable backend design and production-ready deployment.
